### This code is for EE3007 - RF and Optical Communication 2019 
_Python version and packages needed_
* Python 3.5 or above
* Numpy 
* CV2
* Scipy

_Descrption of the files_
* **Dynamic_multi_icarus3.0.py** - Read the CAS-A data and plots the dynamic spectrum(Spectrogram)
* **Code.py** - Reads the spectrogram generated by Dynamic_multi_icarus3.0.py and does the image processing on the spectrogram to detect and remove the RFI affected values. Then uses NMF for mitigation.
* **Synthetic.py** - Generate synthetic RF signal to see the effectiveness of the method. Add RFI noise and use the developed mitigation technique and compare it with the orignally generated data.
